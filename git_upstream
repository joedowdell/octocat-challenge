Explain what the "upstream" remote is usually used for, in your own words

"upstream" command in git directs where you are pushing your repo. 

For example:

		$	git push origin master

Would push master branch to the origin on github

		$ git push heroku master

Where as the above would push the master branch for deployment onto heroku.
